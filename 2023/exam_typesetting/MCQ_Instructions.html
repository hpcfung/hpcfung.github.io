<h2>Workflow</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Copy and paste</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Pick the first word document and copy the MCQs.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Copy the questions only: eg no header.</li>
        <li>Note that these MCQs will be listed first in the final document.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Make sure each question number is included, especially the first one (eg "1.").</li>
    <li>The program accepts and expects the following format only. Change the text in the textarea on the website into the following before adding (or contact the author to include new formats).</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Questions: "1.", "1)", "1.)", "1 " (any number)</li>
        <li>Answers: "A. ", "A) ", "A.) ", "A " (from A to F)(A or a)</li>
        <li>Parts: "i.", "i)", "i.)", "i " (from i to x)(upper or lower case)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>These should include most cases, so in practice you can just add immediately and verify in the preview window.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>Acceptable "answers":</p>
<pre>
A. Administer pain medication as prescribed.
A Administer granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) injection as prescribed.
a) "Counselling services can provide emotional support for both the patient and family members."    
</pre>
<p>Note that the program can deal with most formatting errors, such as empty lines at the beginning or end, or extra whitespace at the beginning of each line. Hence it is fine to copy and paste from the word document directly. eg the following is ok:</p>
<pre>

    1) You are an OT student nurse mentor and orientating them in their first day placement. When you introduce the Clean/ Semi-restricted Zone such as clean corridor, what is the minimum requirement of attire for the personnel?
    i.) OT attire
    ii.) Mask
    iii.) OT Shoes
    iv.) Cap
    A. i.) + ii.)+ iii.)
    B. i.) + iii.) + iv.)
    C. i.) + ii.) +iv.)
    D. All of the above

<h3>Step 2: Proofreading</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Click the "Add raw text" button to add the raw MCQs. Note that the new MCQs are merged with the MCQs that were added previously.</li>
    <li>Proofread the text under "Preview" and edit if necessary.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The question, answer, and part markers are replaced by "_Q:", "_A:", and "_P:"; this is normal.</li>
        <li>They will be numbered automatically in the next step.</li>
        <li>The top empty line is also normal.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Repeat Step 1 and 2 for the MCQs from the other word documents. The MCQs in the final document will be listed in the order they were added in.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3: Generation</h3>
<ul>
    <li>When all the MCQs have been added and the text has been proofread, click the "Generate" botton below.</li>
    <li>To work on a new document, reload the webpage and start from Step 1 again.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Behavior</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Removes empty lines except the empty line between questions.</li>
    <li>Only detects "questions", "answers", and "parts" if they are at the beginning of a line (possibly preceded by spaces).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Warning</h2>
<ol>
    <li>During the initial copy and paste step, underscores are not copied. These have to be added manually to the final .docx file.
        <ul>
            <li>eg: ______is considered a universal donor whereas_________ a universal recipient</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Only the text that is part of a question, answer, or part is retained in the .docx file.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Possible issues</h2>
<ol>
    <li>When copy and pasting the text from the generated .docx document to another, there may be formatting issue.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>eg the numbering is messed up? Empty lines are also numbered.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>If the empty line before the question is deleted, the numbering for the question subparts (i., ii., iii., etc) will be messed up.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Future features</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Input MC answers as well. [[A]] Generate two .docx, one with and without answers.</li>
    <li>Generate the front page and footers.</li>
    <li>i.) + iii.) + iv.) to i, iii, & iv?</li>
    <li>Add short Qs.</li>
    <li>To request additional features, contact the author.</li>
</ol>
